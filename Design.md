## Overview

Draw a house using python package called turtle graphics.

## Background: 
### Motivations
### Other solutions
### Current Goals

Your house must have:

- At least 4 windows
- At least two garage doors
- At least one door
- At least two trees
- One or more clouds

### Non-Goals

We won't draw a castle.
### Future goals

No concern.

### Data validation/what are potential error states?
### Logging/monitoring/observability

### Security/Privacy
### What will you test?

## Third Party dependencies

We will use python (version 3.8) and standard library called turtle to draw a house.

## Homework Logging

1. We have different ways of using python and python packages. 
- Binglan will use pyenv and venv
- Rikiya will use conda
We both use python=3.8.7 (it's Binglan's default version).

1. We are not going to use Docker for this project.

1. Next step is to
- get familiar with turtle
- draw an overview of our house in some shared doc (google slide, draw.io, etc.)?
