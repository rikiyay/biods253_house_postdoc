## Overview

Draw a house using python package called turtle graphics.

## Background: 
### Motivations
### Other solutions
### Current Goals

Your house must have:

- At least 4 windows
- At least two garage doors
- At least one door
- At least two trees
- One or more clouds

### Non-Goals

We won't draw a castle.
### Future goals

N/A
## Detailed Design
### User requirements
### New/changed data structures?
### What APIs will you use/change?
### Throughput/latency/cost/efficiency concerns?

No concern.

### Data validation/what are potential error states?
### Logging/monitoring/observability

N/A

### Security/Privacy
### What will you test?

## Third Party dependencies

We will use python (version 3.8) and standard library called turtle to draw a house.
## Work Estimates

## Alternative Approaches

## Related Work?

## Homework Logging

We have different ways of using python and python packages. 
- Binglan will use pyenv and venv
- Rikiya will use conda
We both use python=3.8.7 (it's Binglan's default version).

Next step is to
- get familiar with turtle
- draw an example of house in some shared doc

Your house must have:
- At least 4 windows: TBD
- At least two garage doors: TBD
- At least one door: TBD
- At least two trees: TBD
